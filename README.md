# Express & TypeScript Demo Project for CI/CD Pipeline between GitLab and AWS EC2

This template project is created for implementation of CI/CD Pipeline between GitLab and AWS EC2.

Techs I used in AWS Linux 2: Nginx, PM2

Shall we review [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](./.gitlab-ci.yml) file?

## Review of `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yml
stages: #1
  - build-deploy #2

build-deploy: #3
  stage: build-deploy #4
  image: alpine:latest #5
  script: #6
    - chmod og= $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY #7
    - apk update && apk add openssh-client #8
    - ssh -i $SSH_PRIVATE_KEY -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no  $STAGE_SERVER_USER@$STAGE_SERVER_IP "sh $CI_SCRIPT_PATH" #9
```
#### #1 and #2
- We have to declare the jobs that will be running under the `stages` field.
- There were build and deploy stages but I decided to one job is enough
- Then I created a sh script as [`follows`](#shScript).

#### #3: We define the jobs that we already declared like that.

#### #4: We specify stage name again.

#### #5
- We specify the Docker image that will be running to execute our scripts.
- I came across the usage of alpine image, there were ssh executions in the example of `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that's why I choosed it.
- There are many images in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) for many of usage.

#### #6
- This part is most important part for me. Because, the scripts that we want to execute when pipeline is triggered place under of this field.

#### #7
- Remove the read, write, and execute permission for all users except the `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY file variable`â€™s owner.
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY file variable` is our private ssh key that have been added in `GitLab repo > Settings > CI/CD` to connect AWS EC2 instance (idk that is whether the best practice or not).

#### #8
- We update alpine
- We install openssh

#### #9
- Then we execute ssh command that executes sh script in remote server.

After build process, there would be a folder named `dist`. This is output directory that would be created as consequence of compiling app.ts file to app.js file. In addition, there will be a [`html`](./index.html) file too (cf. [`package.json` build script](./package.json)).
